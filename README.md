# Stack and Queue Visualizer

## Description
This project is a visualizer for both **Stack** and **Queue** data structures, allowing users to better understand how these data structures work. It provides a user-friendly interface to **push**, **pop**, and **peek** elements in the **stack** and **enqueue**, **dequeue**, and **peek** elements in the **queue**, with real-time updates on their states.

## Features
### Stack:
- **Push**: Add elements to the stack and visually see them.
- **Pop**: Remove elements from the stack and observe the changes.
- **Peek**: View the top element of the stack without removing it.
- **Reset**: Clear the stack and start fresh.
- **Stack Info**: Display the current top element, size of the stack, and last pushed/popped element.

### Queue:
- **Enqueue**: Add elements to the queue and visually see them.
- **Dequeue**: Remove elements from the front of the queue.
- **Peek**: View the front element of the queue without removing it.
- **Reset**: Clear the queue and start fresh.
- **Queue Info**: Display the current front and rear elements, size of the queue, and last enqueued/dequeued element.

## Technologies Used
